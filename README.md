> A communications desk that sits politely behind your community, ready to help.

KADE is a Telegram assistant that reads the room before it speaks. It manages your groups, learns from your knowledge sources, and replies like a thoughtful teammate. Set it up in an afternoon. Refine it forever.

## What KADE does

**Conversations, not just commands**
KADE reads context, replies like a thoughtful teammate, and knows when to stay quiet.

**Cites its sources**
Point it at your knowledge sources — blog URLs, house rules, tone of voice guidelines. It reads them and cites them when it answers.

**Full group moderation**
Add, remove, mute, warn, pin, schedule. Set rules once, enforce them everywhere.

**Multi-group, one workspace**
Run multiple bots from a single dashboard. Assign different rules and knowledge sources per bot or per group.

**Live oversight**
Watch replies in real time. Pause, edit, take over, hand back. Full audit trail included.

## Getting started

**1. Create your bot in Telegram**
Head to [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and create a new bot. Copy your bot token.

**2. Train it on your knowledge**
Drop in blog URLs, write house rules, and define your tone of voice from the dashboard.

**3. Invite KADE to your group**
Invite KADE to your Telegram group. Promote it to admin if you want moderation powers.

**4. Monitor and step in anytime**
See every message and reply in your dashboard. Pause or take over at any point.
